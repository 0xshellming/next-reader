import { Basic } from "../../components/examples.tsx";

<Callout title='Prerequisite'>
  Have you setup your app with the appropriate [**adapter**](./adapters)? Then you are all set!
</Callout>

Supports:

- Panning and zooming, including keyboard and mouse controls
- Text selection
- Annotations and links (including internal!)
- Customizable toolbar
- Customizable page rendering
- Outline and thumbnail navigation

## Usage

To get started, you will need to create a basic PDFReader component:

```jsx
import { Root, Viewport, Pages, Page } from "@unriddle-ai/pdf-viewer";

const MyPDFReader = () => (
  <Root fileURL='path/to/my.pdf'>
    <Viewport>
      <Pages>
        <Page>
          <CanvasLayer />
        </Page>
      </Pages>
    </Viewport>
  </Root>
);
```

The examples below have been styled with `tailwindcss` but you could use any other CSS framework or style. Styles needed for the PDFReader components to work properly are included in the package.

## Examples

### Basic

The simplest PDF reader you can make. It still supports zooming in and out. If you need support text selection, annotations, or links, you will need to add more components.
