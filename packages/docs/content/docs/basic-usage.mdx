- Customizable toolbar
- Customizable page rendering
- Outline and thumbnail navigation

## Usage

To get started, you will need to create a basic PDFReader component:

```jsx
import { Root, Viewport, Pages, Page } from "@unriddle-ai/pdf-viewer";
import { GlobalWorkerOptions } from "pdfjs-dist";

import "pdfjs-dist/web/pdf_viewer.css";

GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = new URL(
  "pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.mjs",
  import.meta.url
).toString();

const MyPDFReader = () => (
  <Root fileURL='path/to/my.pdf'>
    <Viewport>
      <Pages>
        <Page>
          <CanvasLayer />
        </Page>
      </Pages>
    </Viewport>
  </Root>
);
```

The examples below have been styled with `tailwindcss` but you could use any other CSS framework or style. Styles needed for the PDFReader components to work properly are included in the package.
